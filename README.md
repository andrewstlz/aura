# aura.
*your digital mirror, sprinkled with magic*  
AI-powered photo editing assistant integrating pre-trained computer vision models.

## how it works 🫆
Aura integrates multiple pretrained computer vision models into a cohesive editing pipeline. Users input images through a web interface, select desired enhancements via natural language or UI controls, and receive processed results in real-time. The natural language command is first processed by an intent recognition model to map the request (e.g. 'make my face slimmer') to the specific Core Processing Path (e.g. face reshaping). Each module operates independently, allowing users to apply single or combined effects while maintaining interactive performance.

## why aura is just different 🪄
- not just "another AI beauty app" - actually powered by convolutional neural networks and advanced face landmark detection.
- focused on natural enhancements, not artificial filters.
- custom features selected by the user.

## what you can expect 🌹
- face reshaping
- skin smoothing and blemish removal
- lighting and tone correction
- background enhancement
- modernize old photo

## how we build it ⚙️
- Backend / ML: PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, ONNX
- Frontend: Streamlit, React
- Deployment: Docker
